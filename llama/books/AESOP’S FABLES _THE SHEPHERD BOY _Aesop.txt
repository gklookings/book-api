Aesop (620-560 BC) - A Greek writer and/or collector of fables about whose life little is known. He is said to have been born a slave and later released, but many believe he is a legendary figure. Aesop’s Fables are animal stories with moral lessons, many of which are from Oriental and ancient sources dated hun- dreds of years before his time. The Shepherd Boy (550 BC) - “A liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth.”
THE SHEPHERD BOY
There was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest. It was rather lonely for him all day, so he thought    upon a plan by which he could get a little company and some excitement. He   rushed down towards the village calling out “Wolf, Wolf,” and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of them stopped with him for a considerable time. This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterwards he tried the same trick, and  again the  villagers came to  his help. But shortly after this  a Wolf actually did  come out from the forest, and began to worry the sheep, and the boy, of course,  cried out “Wolf, Wolf,” still louder than before. But this time the villagers, who    had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was again deceiving them, and no- body stirred to come to his help. So the Wolf made a good meal off the boy’s    flock, and when the boy complained, the wise man of the village said:
A liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth.
